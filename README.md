# Alumni-Management
## Introduction
This is a simple Java program for university alumni management system. The aim of this project is to demonstrate the use of object oriented
programming to make simple applications. The project uses CSV(Comma seprated values) to read and write data into Book1.csv. This was done in order to understand reading and writing into files. Hence, SQL wasn't used although it would have been cleaner that way.
